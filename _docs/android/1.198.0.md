Tedee Dry Contact allows you to control your Tedee smart lock using traditional electronic methods like switches, wired legacy systems, and local smart home integrations. As a compact module wired to your controller and power source, Tedee Dry Contact unlocks Tedee GO or Tedee PRO via Bluetooth, without needing an app or internet connection. Enhance accessibility and simplify protection by syncing your smart lock with buttons and automatic door openers. Connect your Tedee PRO or Tedee GO to your wired smart home or alarm system, enjoying central management and local integration.
