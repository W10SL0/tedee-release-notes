## Fixed Wear OS application 
We fixed issue with infinite progress bar on watch.

## Fixed multiple location popups 
We fixed issue that make several "enable location" prompts appearing at once.

## Fixed lock calibration  
If the lock was stuck during second step, it was impossible to calibrate the lock and reset whole calibration process. Now it is fixed.
