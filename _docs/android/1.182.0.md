## Preview feature: Locks with Auto Unlock that are near each other will share a common set of Range-In and Range-Out zones.
Locks with enabled auto-unlock and location that is 10 meter or less from other locks will use common set of Range-In and Range-Out zones.
The center of common zones will be set in the middle of all locks that are near each other. Diameter of each zone will be set to higest value that is set for the lock from all locks that are near each other.

Appropriate information about if the lock is near other locks will be visible in location settings, as well as information about zones in "Range zones" settings.
