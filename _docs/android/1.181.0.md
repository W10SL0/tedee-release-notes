## New remote calibration method
We have introduced a new method for remote lock and pull spring calibration that no longer requires push notifications.

## Dynamic mode 
App will automatically open lock details of the nearest lock, based on Auto Unlock location settings. User must be in a range in zone of that lock. This feature can be disabled in the app settings: (Home page -> Dynamic mode).

## Clearing backstack
When the app is inactive for some time and the user is outside the lock's range, it will display either the devices list or the lock details (if only one lock is present).
