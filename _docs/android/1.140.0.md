## Canceling Auto-unlock if the user unlocked the lock from the mobile app over the last 5 minutes
Auto-unlock process will not start if 5 minutes has not elapsed since last unlock action from mobile for that Lock. This change was made to prevent false auto-unlocks that could happen when entering the auto-unlock zone event was delayed by the system and user unlock the Lock from mobile before auto-unlock process starts.

## Request to ignore battery optimizations for auto-unlock.
To remove delays in auto-unlock process, we added automatic request to ignore battery optimizations. The popup will be shown after enabling auto-unlock process and app start if the user has any lock with enabled auto-unlock feature.
