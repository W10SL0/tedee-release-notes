## Switched to FCM v1 notifications in Azure Notification Hub
We migrated our notification to FCM v1 that will give us better security via access tokens, more efficient customization of messages across platforms and more extendable and future-proof for new client platform versions.

## Updated priorities of top bar message
The priorities of the top bar messages have been recently updated. The new order includes NoInternetConnection, IncidentDetected, OfflineMode, and ReSignNeeded. This adjustment will help ensure that users receive important messages promptly and in the correct order.
