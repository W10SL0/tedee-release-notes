## Moved Bluetooth Only Mode to App Settings
We've relocated the Bluetooth Only Mode from lock settings to the app settings. Now, enabling this option will affect all locks. Additionally, we've extended the time range settings â€“ you can now set it for up to 23 hours and 59 minutes.

## Automatically turn Bluetooth Only Mode on during related incident
Besides moving this feature to the app settings, we've introduced an automatic activation of Bluetooth Only Mode during Remote Access Control incidents. Once the incident is over, Bluetooth Only Mode will be auto-disabled. The user also has the option to manually disable this option during the incident. The text displayed in the incident bar has been updated to provide clearer information about the current situation.

## Confirmation before deactivating Bridge API
A confirmation step has been added before resetting the Bridge API configuration. To restore default settings, navigate to the 3-dot menu in the configuration view and select "Reset configuration". Note: Using the switch to disable/enable the Bridge API does not revert settings to default.

## Check lock state after getting error with BLE retry
We have added fixes and improvements when performing the lock closing/opening operation. We now check the status of the lock when getting an error with retry via BLE.

## Improved BT connection with bridge
We have improved the process of connecting to bridge via BT. At the moment when we have a lot of locks connected via BT, and for example we want to configure Wi-Fi settings, we temporarily disconnect the Bluetooth connection between locks to prioritize the bridge connection.

## Improvements with creating/editing pins
We omit passing default start time and default end time during creating/editing pin if is not needed.

## Logout Confirmation Added to Wear OS App
We have added confirmation of the decision to log out of the wear os application. The user can decide whether I want to continue the operation and will need a phone to log in again, or simply cancel and return to the previous view.
