## Pin management via bridge improvements
We improved how pin management behaves, especially via bridge:
- When you enter the pin management screen the first time, the loader will be shown
- Properly handle a situation when two mobiles try to manage pins via bridge
- Properly handle maximum amount of pins
- Pin weekdays and daily hours are adjusted accordingly to the lock time zone
- Improved deleting pin progress design

\* _Some of these changes will also apply to device share._

## Pair keypad with bridge
You can now pair keypad with bridge. Bridge doesn't fully support keypad but this change is the first step for full support of the keypad in bridge.

## New activity logs
We added activity logs for pull spring action via pin and semi-locked via pin.
