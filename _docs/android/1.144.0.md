## Added button to fetch the Wi-Fi name for "Check Wi-Fi" in the advanced Auto-unlock settings
This button will automatically fill "Check Wi-Fi" name field with the name of the network that the phone is currently connected. This is easier and more convenient way of providing a home network name for Auto-unlock.
