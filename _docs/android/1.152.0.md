## Improved connection time over Bluetooth for shared locks (for users without remote access granted)
Shared lock without remote access granted and connected via bridge, requires Bluetooth connection to unlock, lock or pull.
We are only connecting to such a lock on demand, when user wants to make some operation like unlock, lock or pull.
To improve time required between connecting and send operation command to the lock, app will automatically connect to such a lock as soon as user enters lock details page of this lock and app will keep this connection for short amount of time. This will reduce the time between making an operation in the application and physical movement of the lock.

## Fixed custom time selector
Now pull spring duration could be set to 60 seconds.
