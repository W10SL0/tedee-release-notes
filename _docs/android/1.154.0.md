## Fixed status bar for offline mode.
We improved logic for offline mode status bar appearance. Now it will not be shown when not needed.

## Fixed lock status after reconnecting over Bluetooth 
The correct lock status is displayed if the user retries through Bluetooth after an unsuccessful remote attempt via a bridge.

## Fixed action widget after logout - added action selection step.
After reconfiguring action widget, we added an extra step - select action so that the user could choose any action he wants.
