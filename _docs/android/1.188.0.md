Updated "Resign" Bar Design:
The design of the resign bar has been updated to provide a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
Also all devices paired with the bridge will now be automatically disconnected in case when sign in is needed. 

Add another device button:
We have introduced a new button on the final screen, allowing users to easily add another device after successfully adding a new one.

Enhanced Wi-Fi Configuration for Weak Signal Strength:
To address issues with poor signal strength, we have improved the Wi-Fi configuration process for bridges.

Screen remains On throughout device addition:
To provide a seamless user experience, the screen will now remain on throughout the entire device addition process. This eliminates any interruptions or delays caused by screen dimming.

Activation code validation:
To insure that the scanned activation code is valid, we added additional activation code validation. 

Revamped design for streamlined device adding
We have updated the device adding process to make it more streamlined and intuitive. The new design aims to simplify the setup process and improve user satisfaction.
