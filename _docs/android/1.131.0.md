## Preview: Keypad
In this version, we introduced support for our new device, Keypad. This device allows you to pair it with lock and set pin codes that can be used to unlock a paired lock. Pin codes can have also restricted access, in the same way as you can restrict access to the shared device.
Right now, keypad is working only via Bluetooth and it cannot be paired with bridge. Also, it is available only for preview testers.

## Increased delay for the 2nd click for unlock widgets
We increased delay for 2nd unlock button click so user have more time to do it.

## Improved app stability
