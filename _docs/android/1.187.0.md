## Seamless Firmware Updates

Now, you can start updating your device's firmware and the process will keep running smoothly in the background. This means you can switch to other apps or navigate away without interrupting the update.

## Screen Stays Awake During Updates

We've made sure your screen won't dim or go to sleep while your device is updating. This keeps you informed about the update progress until it's fully completed.

## Bridge Quick Configuration

Setting up a new bridge is now more straightforward. You can configure the basic settings before finishing of the adding process, making the setup smoother and faster.
