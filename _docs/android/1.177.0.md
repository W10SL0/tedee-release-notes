## We have improved the app's operability with TalkBack to make it more accessible for blind users or those with vision disabilities.
We made our app accessible for blind people. By using TalkBack feature, you can now easly navigate through my devices page and device details page. Also, you can easly operate your lock and gate devices.
We also make sure that TalkBack is reading elements in correct language that user set up.
