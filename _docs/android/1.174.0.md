## The system now displays unlinked information for gates that cannot be found in the blebox integration
The Gates devices that are present in our applications but couldn't be found in blebox account will display status unlinked. This means that user need to check the status of his integrations with blebox or check directly his blebox account.

## There is now a possibility to delete all gates when the blebox account is disconnected from tedee.
When user will disconnect his blebox account from tedee, there is posibility to remove all devices, that came from this blebox account, from tedee.

If you turn off remote access and set the location for your gate, users can only open the gate when they're close to it.
