## Removed MAC address from device information page
Some time ago we introduced changes in Lock Bluetooth connection that made MAC address irrelevant. It can be changed Lock restarts, so we do not use it to scan for device anymore. Therefore we removed this address from device information page

## Fixed empty error message while adding the lock 
In some cases, and empty error screen was shown in adding Lock process. We made sure that now it will contain useful tips on how to address connection problems.

## Removed logic that automatically resetted Bluetooth
A few releases ago, we tried approach with automatically resetting Bluetooth in case of some connection errors. It helped in some cases, but also sometimes broked other features and casues errors. We decided to stop following this path. From now on, we will not be automatically resetting Bluetooth connection.
