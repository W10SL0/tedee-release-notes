## Home Screen
We know that based on to which device types our users have access, their usage of our app can be different. To make it more convenient we introduced Home Screen.

Home Screen is the main page of the application where user have access to the side menu as well as it is first screen that user will see after logging in or launching application when user was logged in previously.

This main page can contains "My Devices" page, which was currently used, or "Lock Details" page.

### Home Screen: My Devices
My Devices will present as the Home Screen when user have no access to any devices or when user have access to other devices than Locks.\

### Home Screen: Lock Details
Lock Details will be set as Home Screen when user has access to only Lock devices. My Devices page will be not accessible for the user but all required functionality is available for the user from Lock Details. BY having Lock Details page as a Home Screen, user has faster access to all necessary Locks features just after launching the app. If user has access to more than one device, he can swipe (left or right) between Locks.\
