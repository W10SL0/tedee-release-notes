## Seeing the Closest Lock in the 'Range Out' Zone
When you're near a lock and enter its 'range out' zone, the app will automatically show you the closest lock when you are open the app. For this to work, make sure the “Smart Startup” option is turned on in the home screen settings.

## Home Screen Update: The 'Always Lock' Option
There's a new addition to the home screen settings - "Always Lock.” When you turn this on, the first lock from your lock list will always be displayed on your home screen.

## Range Zones: View All Grouped Locks on the Map
If you have multiple locks in the group you can now view all of them together on the map. Plus, the app shows the sizes of group’s calculated 'range in' and 'range out' zones.

## Lock Location: Show Locks with Auto Unlock on the Map
In the lock location settings, you can now see all locks with auto-unlock enabled marked on the map. Locks located within 10 meters of the selected one will appear in blue, while the rest will be red. If you zoom in closely on the map, you'll see a dashed circle indicating the size of the group.
