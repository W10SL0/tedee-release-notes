## Support for Keypads bell button notification
Lock forwards bell button notification to mobile apps. It is a necessary component for the whole feature.

## Forward Keypad's battery level
To enhance keypad battery life mobile apps do not connect to the keypad automatically.\
During entering pin or bell button notification keypad connects to lock and additionally passes battery level.\
As a result, the lock can pass such information to users via Bridge or directly to the app during BLE connection.

## Fixed connection issues with unpaired keypad
We fixed an issue of accepting a keypad connection that was already unpaired with that lock.
