## Improved lock status changes in Widgets when device is connected via bridge
We've made an improvement to ensure that information about lock's status are always up to date. You will see faster result of called operation (Open, Close or Pull) and changed status in Widgets.


## Auto-unlock process improvements
If mobile detects your Lock in Bluetooth range before receiving In-Zone enter event it will wait for it for 3 minutes and then next Auto-Unlock process will be blocked. Leaving Out-zone event will reset this.


## Preview: "Force-unlock" mode improvements
When lock is uncalibrated, it might not know which way should it rotate to unlock the door. We added a possibility to force open in other direction if this is the case.
