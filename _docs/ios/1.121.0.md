## Improved lock status changes in Widgets when device is connected via bridge
We've made an improvement to ensure that information about lock's status are always up to date. You will see faster result of called operation (Open, Close or Pull) and changed status in Widgets.


## Preview: "Force-unlock" mode improvements
When lock is uncalibrated, it might not know which way should it rotate to unlock the door. We added a possibility to force open in other direction if this is the case.
