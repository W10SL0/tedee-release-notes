## Preview: Keypad
In this version, we introduced support for our new device, Keypad. This device allows you to pair it with lock and set pin codes that can be used to unlock a paierd lock. Pin codes can have also restricted access, in the same way as you can restrict access to the shared device.
Right now, keypad is working only via Bluetooth and it cannot be paired with bridge. Also, it is available only for preview testers.

## New design for sharing device
We changed how access limits are sets. Now, you can set time restrictions, specific days, and daily hours. You can select all of them or whichever will apply to your needs.

## Issue with Shortcuts app
We fixed issue with pull spring action from shortcuts. Now, if lock is unlocked and pull spring is enabled, open lock shortcut action will perform pull spring.
