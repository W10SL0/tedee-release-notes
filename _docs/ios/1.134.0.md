## Uniform UX designs for removing device sharing as we have for removing PINs
Previously, we introduced a new loading design that appears when you are removing PIN. Now, it is also available when you are removing device share.

## Apple Watch layout improvements
We fixed the layout on Apple Watch, now it should look better and the device name should be always visible.

## Shortcuts suggestions contain only general open/close actions instead of actions for each lock separately
We noticed that in the shortcuts app, our predefined action suggestions for each available lock was often confusing users. Now, only general action suggestion is available. You can select the desired lock inside shortcuts action directly.

## Issues with the firmware update
We fixed the issues that could happen during updating device firmware and resulted in a crash of our application.
