## Possibility to copy account email in the user profile page
We added possibility to copy account email in the user profile page. This could be especially helpful for users that used "Continue with Apple" and hide my email options. By combining this two features, account email is not easily readable and is not easy to share with someone else. This feature, to copy account email, allows users to quickly copy their emails and make sure to receive shares from someone else without any issues.\

## Case sensitive sorting of "My devices" list
We fixed the issue that makes sorting devices on my devices list page, case sensitive.

## Clicking the "Keypad low battery" notification redirects to the keypad details page
We fixed the issue when user opens application via "Keypad low battery" notification. Previously, homepage was presented to the user but now, keypad details page will be presented with the keypad from which this notification came.
