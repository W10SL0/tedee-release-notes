## Fixed issue that could cause the selected lock to change on the lock details page without user interaction.
We identified and fixed rare case when after entering lock details page, selected lock could be changed to the first one from the list without user interaction.

## Fixed issue that could fail the first attempt of the calibration process after replacing batteries in the tedee GO lock.
We fixed issue that could prevent user to maKe clibration of tedee GO via bridge just after replacing the batteries. This issue could happend only when user stays on lock settings page while the batteries are replaced.

## Resolved a performance issue.
We identified issue that caused increased memory usage over time. For most of the users, the increase in memory consumption was insignificant and killing the application freed the used memory.
