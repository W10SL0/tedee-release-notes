## Issue with descriptions that didn't fit on some screens
On some devices, description description on Firmware Update page, when new firmware is avaiable, didn't fully fit.

## Issue when admin tried adding device after factory reset
User with admin access to the devices that was factory reseted could start re-adding process for this device. This user will be not able to re-add this device and the process will fail. As design, this user shouldn't be able to re-add this device and we fixed this by disabling possibility to start re-adding process for users with admin access to the device.

## Issue with possible multiple updates during device adding process and potential incorrect name of the device
Adding process will upload firmware only to the device that will be added to the account. Also, possible issue with setting incorrect name for the device was fixed.
