## Lock unlocked alerts cannot be enabled when lock is not paired with bridge
We fixed issue where lock unlocked notification could be enabled when lock was not paired with bridge. This feature requires that lock is paired in bridge and otherwise it cannot work correctly.

## Improved auto unlock Wi-Fi checking when a custom Wi-Fi name is set
Now, Wi-Fi check will be performed when mobile phone leave exit zone or enter the enter zone. This resolves issue when user provided his own Wi-Fi name for check Wi-Fi settings and his phone was already connected to this Wi-Fi when he reach his door.
