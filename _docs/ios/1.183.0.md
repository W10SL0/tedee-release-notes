## Smart statup
We have made little improvements to home screen settings to better describe how smart startup feature works.

## New home screen option "Lock" will display first lock details when you open the app.
We have introduced new option in home screen settings. Previous "Locks" option was renamed to "Default" and works as before. New "Lock" option opens first lock's details page when you open the app. You can go devices list using back arrow whenever you want.

## Preview feature: Multiple locks group is presented now on the map
When you place lock near other lock they will now be grouped. To make it easier we indicate such grouping with other locks that will be grouped with current one with changing their color from red to light blue.
When you zoom in we will show cirle that will help you position lock near to other locks to group them.

## Preview feature: Changing Auto-unlock ranges sizes change them for all locks in group.
When locks are grouped together changing ranges sizes for one lock in the group will now change it also for other locks in the same group.  
When new lock is added to the group it's ranges sizes will be updated to the one set for the group it is added to.

## Lock details screen elements were displayed improperly.
We fixed issue when in rare cases lock details screen could be displayed differently than normal.

## Added the missing complication icon for Apple Watch Ultra.
Now Apple Watch Ultra displays properly complication icons.

## Log files size will be now smaller.
When user had multiple locks on the account with lot's of activities, log files could grow too high. We have fixed the issue to keep logs size in reasonable size.
