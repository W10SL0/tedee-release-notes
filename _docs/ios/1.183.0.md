## Smart statup
We have made little improvements to home screen settings to better describe how smart startup feature works.

## New home screen option "Lock" will display first lock details when you open the app.
We have introduced new option in home screen settings. Previous "Locks" option was renamed to "Default" and works as before. New "Lock" option opens first lock's details page when you open the app. You can go devices list using back arrow whenever you want.

## Lock details screen elements were displayed improperly.
We fixed issue when in rare cases lock details screen could be displayed differently than normal.

## Added the missing complication icon for Apple Watch Ultra.
Now Apple Watch Ultra displays properly complication icons.

## Log files size will be now smaller.
When user had multiple locks on the account with lot's of activities, log files could grow too high. We have fixed the issue to keep logs size in reasonable size.
