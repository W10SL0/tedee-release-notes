## Issue with calibration during adding process
We fixed the issue that made lock calibration during adding process impossible. This only happens when user had already a bridge device on his account. Calibration from lock settings was working correctly.

## Issue that could make auto unlock process unstable
We improved stability of auto unlock process in case when there is an error in secure communication between phone and lock. Now, such a case will be properly handled and new secure connection will be made in such a way, that shouldn't blocked auto unlock process.

## Issue that could unlock the door twice during auto unlock process
In case when there is an error in secure communication between phone and lock, we identify and fix and issue that could caused that lock was auto unlocked twice. This case caused that app lost information that lock was successfully auto unlocked and because of that, auto unlock process wasn't completed.

## Issue with software updated notification
We fixed issue where software updated notifications wasn't delivered to the user.
