## Issue with the lack of information when user needed to log in again
We fixed issue when user needs to sign in again but no information about it is presented to the user.

## Red dot is now presented when a device indicates low battery while charging
When lock has less than 15% but it is charging, red dot wasn't presented in lock settings. Now, it will be presented until lock charge to more that 15%.

## Issue with the looped devices certificate downloads
We fix rare issue when app could start downloading devices certificates in loop, so for each device, certificate was regenerated and downloaded multiple times at almost the same time. This could result in inability to connect to the device via Bluetooth.
