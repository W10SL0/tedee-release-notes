## Widgets minor issues
Widget should works more stable. Also, we fixed issue that prevent connection to lock via Bluetooth after widget was first added.

## Activity logs display order
We fixed issue with grouping activity logs. It was possible that activity logs from different months but same day was shown under same section (same day).

## Bluetooth status update issues in the connection settings
We fixed issue with refreshing Bluetooth status in screen that inform user about requires connection. Now, when user enable Bluetooth on this screen, this information will be updated and user can continue.
