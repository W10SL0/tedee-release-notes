## Issue with Auto-unlock in background
When lock was not paired with bridge, auto-unlock was not working in background. In order to perform auto-unlock, user needed to open the application and then app autmatically opened the lock.

## Issue during adding device
While adding new device and after firmware update, the screen with information to switch on the device could be showed. After few seconds application was automatically reconnecting to the device and continued the add process. This incorrect message was fixed.

## Issue with security PIN
When user set security PIN in application and switched the account, security PIN wasn't disabled and app requires the same PIN even when user was logged in to a different account.
