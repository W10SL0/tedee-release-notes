## Pin management via bridge improvements
We improve how pin management behaves, especially via bridge:
- When you enter the pin management screen the first time, the loader will be shown
- Properly handle a situation when two mobiles try to manage pins via bridge
- Properly handle maximum amount of pins
- Pin weekdays and daily hours are adjusted accordingly to the lock time zone
- Improve clickability of day and date icon in Access Limits section
- Start and end time for daily hours cannot be the same
- Swipe gesture between shares and pins tabs in device share screen
- Improve deleting pin progress design

\* _Some of these changes will also apply to device share._

## Pair keypad with bridge
You can now pair keypad with bridge. Bridge doesn't fully support keypad but this change is the first step for full support of the keypad in bridge.

## New activity logs
We add activity logs for pull spring action via pin and semi-locked via pin.

## New date picker for temporary access limit
We change date picker in temporary access limit to more convenient and modern way of selecting date as well as fix for missing possibility to select year in previous date picker.
