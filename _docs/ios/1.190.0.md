## Improved auto-unlock reliability when the bridge iBeacon is detected before the entering range event is detected
We fixed issue where lock could be unlocked twice if phone detects iBeacon from Bridge before receiving geofence enter zone event.

We fixed issue where previously added and highlighted device was unhighlighted by starting and cancelling new add device process.

## Fixed Activity Logs page bottom space for iPhones with TouchID
We fixed issue where Activity Logs page on iPhones with TouchID had unnecessary bottom space.

## Fixed auto-unlock settings switch when the user is redirected to the Settings app
We fixed issue with auto-unlock settings page, where auto-unlock switch stayed enabled when user switched to system settings to gran location permissions to the app.
