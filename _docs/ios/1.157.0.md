## Information about ending support for iOS 13 soon
In near future, we are planning to drop support for iOS 13 in our application. When this happens, our application running on iOS 13 will still work but we do not guarantee for how long and application will no longer receive any updates. New users will not be able to install our app on iOS 13 but the last supported version should be still available for all users who install our app before support for iOS 13 was dropped.\

## Sharing app logs together with device logs
When user needs to collect device (lock, bridge or keypad) logs, now, app will share both device and app logs

## Clear distinction between app logs and device logs
We change the name of in app logs feature, we hope that this will be less confusing when our support team ask user to share with us app logs.\

## Improved reliability of notifications
We improved how all remote notifications are delivered to the app, this should resolve the problem with not always delivering some of the notifications.

## Issue that could send multiple "lock left unlock" notifications
We fixed the issue that could check multiple times if lock was left unlock and end up with showing to the user multiple notifications about it. Now, it will only works when user was in auto unlock range in zone and user left auto unlock range out zone. When user leave auto unlock range out zone but he didn't enter auto unlock range in zone, app will not check if lock was left unlocked.
