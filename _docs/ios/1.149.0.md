## "Loading" screen at launching the app was removed
"Loading" that was present on my devices page just after launching the app is removed. Also, when user log in or switch his account, home screen will be present with all user devices without need to wait until they will be fetched, which could happened before in case of poor internet connection.

## App settings and global notification settings are stored for the account and synced across all user mobile devices
Home screen, hold to unlock and notifications settings that can be found under settings page that is accessible from side menu, are now synced. That means that this settings will be set to the same value on all user mobile devices where the same Tedee account is used. Also, if user logout or remove the application, this settings will not be lost and next time when user log in into his account, they will be restored.

## Add missing information about Trigger event in Last Status for auto-unlock
Last status page for auto-unlock was extended with information about the auto-unlock trigger. Auto-unlock trigger contains information which event starts auto-unlock process. It can be geofence zone, iBeacon or widget.\
