## We have improved the app's operability with VoiceOver to make it more accessible for blind users or those with vision disabilities.
We made our app accessible for blind people. By using VoiceOver feature, you can now easly navigate through my devices page and device details page. Also, you can easly operate your lock and gate devices.
We also make sure that VoiceOver is reading elements in correct language that user set up.

## When calibration via the bridge fails for some reason, we now suggest using a Bluetooth connection to calibrate the lock.
We found one case where calibration via Bridge could failed and to improve handling of i, we added suggestion to use Bluetooth connection to perform this calibration process.
