## Occasional issues with lock calibration
In some cases, calibration process could show that lock is not ready and user wasn't able to restart calibration process from this screen. Issue was caused by some connection state issue and now, app will refresh connection state after this alert will be shown.

## Issue with "lock jammed" timeout
In some cases, "lock jammed" information was shown even when lock correctly change it's state. Issue was cause by the too short time that was used to discover that lock is jammed.
