## Improved bridge pairing process regarding "cannot connect" message.
Improvement in bridge pairing process was made in regarding how often user have a chance to see "cannot connect" message. After usual 30 sec timeout, if application will not receive any information about changes of lock connection status, application will ask backed about current lock connection status. In most cases after 30 sec lock should be already connect to the bridge and refreshing lock connection status on mobile side will result in smaller chance of displaying "cannot connect" message.

## Issue that could show no available lock to pair during keypad adding process
During adding keypad process, there was a chance that pairing lock with keypad step will not show any available lock to pair, even if such a lock was correctly discovered.

## Issue with "Check Wi-Fi" feature in Auto-unlock settings that was working even when disabled
If Wi-Fi name for "Check Wi-Fi" was set and "Check Wi-Fi" settings was disabled, then this information was not correctly interpreted and "Check Wi-Fi" was still working.

## Issue with "Check Wi-Fi" field name that displayed your name as a suggested SSID
Wi-Fi name field for "Check Wi-Fi" was incorrectly configured which caused iOS keyboard to suggest user name for this field.
