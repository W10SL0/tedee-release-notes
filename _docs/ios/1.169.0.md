## Blebox integration
You can now use Blebox integration to add Blebox doorBox devices to the Tedee app and open a variety of doors and gates (shared entrance doors, barriers, garage doors, entry gates, etc.).

You will find this integration in app settings.

By default all doorbox devices will be using timezone of your phone, but you can update default timezone to your needs, or set it differently for every device in it's settings.

## Gates
Gates added via Blebox integration can be operated and shared as easy as Tedee devices.

You can also control gates using the widgets.

## Link activities
When the gate is opened via a link generated over portal.tedee.com (organization feature) the gate owner or administrator will see the description of this event in the activity logs.

The same applies when the lock is operated via a link generated over portal.tedee.com (organization feature) the lock owner or administrator will see the description of this event in the activity logs.

## Issue with enabling "Bluetooth only" mode and "Force unlock"

We have fixed issue when is was possible to enable "Bluetooth only" mode or starting "Force unlock" with the Bluetooth turned off in the system settings. Now in such situation we will present proper alert and not allow using both features until Bluetooth is turned on.
