## Improved "Use BLE" option when remote lock operation cannot be performed
We improved "Use BLE" option when remote lock operation cannot be performed by keeping Bluetooth connection until lock finish executing operation. This allow us to update lock state in application with correct values directly from the lock.

Wee fixed and issue in our widgets that could perform same lock operation twice.

## Issue with showing incorrect information about the services in the status bar
We improved presenting status bar information and made it more reliable and less misleading.
