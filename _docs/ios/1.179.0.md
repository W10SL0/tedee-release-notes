## Today's View widgets can now be used with VoiceOver
We have further improved app accessibility. It is now possible to operate locks and gates from the "My devices" view and utilize widgets in the "Today's" view.

## Improved app contrast
We have enhanced the contrast and color scheme throughout the entire app.

## Implementation of warnings for automatic hold to unlock when one of the locks is not set up properly for the hold-to-unlock feature
The "Lock details" view now informs the user if "Hold to unlock" is required to open the selected lock. Proper information is displayed in unlock button description.\
