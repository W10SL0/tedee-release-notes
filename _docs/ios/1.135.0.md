## Issues with local access over Bluetooth
We fixed the issue that could happen for quest users while performing lock/unlock operations on the lock via Bluetooth.

## Issue with not active "Bluetooth only" mode for guests
Some guests users without remote access could notice that Bluetooth only mode in the Emergency section was disabled and couldn't be activated

## Issue with active "Remote access" settings in sharing details for users without remote access
The remote access switch was active when guest user opens his share details information. Even that users could enable or disable this switch, changes weren't saved. Now, this switch is disabled (grey out) in the same way that other details information are.
