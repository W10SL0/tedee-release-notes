## More improvements of adding device process
We have added many slight improvements to adding device process to improve user experience and reliability

## Devices on my devices page can now be filtered (Preview feature)
We have added possibility to filter devices on my devices page by name, favorite setting
or organization they can be assigned to. You can use one of the filters or combination of them.
State of the filters is kept between app launches and when the filters screen is hidden.

## Easier navigation through long devices list
We have added button that makes it easier to return to the top of the devices list.
It's also possible to go to top by tapping on the notch (on devices supporting it).

We have added possibility to skip pairing keypad with the lock during adding process.
It can be paired later from keypad details page.
