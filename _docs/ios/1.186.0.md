## Added possibility to configure pull spring behavior for action widgets
We added new type of action for actions widget. "Unlock only" action is available for all locks with configured pull spring. This action will unlock the lock without performing pull spring.
We also renamed previous unlock action to "Unlock & pull" when auto pull spring is enabled or "Unlock or pull" if auto pull spring is disabled.\
