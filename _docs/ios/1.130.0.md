## HomeKit
Homekit integration is avaiable now for all locks with firmware version 1.4 or newer. You can learn how to add your lock to Apple Home app, here: [Apple HomeKit manual](https://tedee.com/knowledge-base/apple-homekit/)


## Emergency mode is now called "troubleshooting"
We decided to change emergency mode name to troubleshooting. This name better describe this feature and it should be less confusing to our users.


## Increase stability of auto-unlock
If user open lock via widget or Siri, while there is pending auto-unlock, this action will stop auto-unlock process. This change is neccessery to make sure that auto-unlock will not open lock after a while when user is already in home.


## Issue with app performance for users with many locks
We identify some issues with our application when user have many locks in his account. Most visible change is smoother animation of swaping between the lock in lock details screen.
