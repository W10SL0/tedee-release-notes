## HomeKit
Homekit integration is available now for all locks with firmware version 1.4 or newer. You can learn how to add your lock to Apple Home app, here [Apple HomeKit manual](https://tedee.com/knowledge-base/apple-homekit/)


## Emergency mode is now called "troubleshooting"
We decided to change emergency mode name to troubleshooting. This name better describes this feature and it should be less confusing to our users.


## Increase stability of auto-unlock
If user opens lock via widget or Siri, while there is pending auto-unlock, this action will stop auto-unlock process. This change is necessary to make sure that auto-unlock will not open lock after a while when user is already at home.


## Issue with app performance for users with many locks
We identified some issues with our application when user has many locks in his account. The most visible change is the smoother animation of swapping between the locks in lock details screen.
