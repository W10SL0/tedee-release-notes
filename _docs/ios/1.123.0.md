## App badge
We added app badge that indicate for how many devices requires user action. This are the same actions for which we are showing red dot in application, like cailbration. This badge will count only devices that are connected via bridge.

# Device after factory reset information
We added infromation that device is after factory reset on connecting screen. For example, when you try to connect to bridge via bluetooth to change WiFi password. Now, if bridge was after factory reset, you will see proper information with posibility to re-add such bridge.

# iBeacon detection
We fixed a bug that didn't report that iBeacon from bridge was successfully detected during auto-unlock process.
